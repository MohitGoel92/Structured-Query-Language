# Structured Query Language

In this repository we have python files where we explore a wide variety of different techniques to query the data for different business tasks. This knowledge is then tested and concretised by the assessment questions which are great for learning and practice. A novice learning SQL, or an experienced individual who is coming back to SQL after some time of not using it will benefit from going through the material.

Topics covered:

- SQL statement fundamentals.
- GROUP BY Statements.
- JOINS
- More complex queries.
- Creating databases and tables.
- Conditional expressions and procedures.
- Assessment Test 1,2,3.
